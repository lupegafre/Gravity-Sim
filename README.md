# Gravity-Sim

By lupegafre.
My WiP n-body simulator made with Pygame.
I'm making this to learn more about programming, so feedback is very welcome.
Code is still messy and slow.
3D movement and camera rotation have been added, but gravity around Z-axis still does not work properly.
An exe made with pyinstaller is also available.
